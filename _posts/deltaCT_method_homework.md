Calculate ΔCt (Delta Ct):  
Δ𝐶𝑡=𝐶𝑡target−𝐶𝑡reference  
ΔΔ𝐶𝑡=Δ𝐶𝑡experimental-Δ𝐶𝑡control  
Fold Change = 2 ^-ΔΔCt

results  
Value = 1 (log₂ = 0): No change in expression.  
Values < 1: Decreased expression (gene suppression).  
Values > 1: Increased expression (gene activation).  

•	We can see that we have Strong Downregulation in: pitx (Sharp decrease - most strongly suppressed by the treatment), sm50 (Strong repression, SM30 (Marked reductio), opt (Significantly lowered expression).  
•	We can see that we have Moderate Downregulation in: synB, pak3, pak4, gcm, ets, Delta – Show 10–50% reduction in expression.  
•	We can see that we have Stable / Minimal Change in: ascs, foxA, soxC – Expression levels close to 1 → indicating no major change relative to the control.  
•	And finally, we can see that we have Upregulation in NGN – Elevated expression - the only gene clearly upregulated after treatment.  
•	soxC and foxA – Slight increase, though not significant.  
Conclusions:  
•	Genes like pitx, sm50, SM30 appear highly sensitive to the treatment – possibly involved in pathways directly inhibited by the compound.  
•	NGN shows relative activation – this might reflect a compensatory mechanism or activation of an alternative signaling pathway.  
•	Genes such as foxA and ascs maintain stable expression – suggesting they are either unaffected or regulated by distinct, treatment-independent pathways.
