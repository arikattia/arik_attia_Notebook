# Protocol for fixation, decalcification and embedding of stony corals
## By Arik Attia 1.2.2026
### This protocol was adjusted and merged from Lisa Skalon’s protocol written on 7.5.2025. and from the methods chapter at Jonathan Levanoni’s paper (2024). 
# Fixation
1.	15 ml FSW (0.2 microns filtered seawater) in a 50 ml tube (for small fragments).
2.	cut and place the sample in the tube.
3.	Leave the fragments in the tube with the FSW for 10 min before adding 1M mgcl2.
4.	Add 0.3 ml of 1M mgcl2 to a single tube and cover the plate with foil for 10 min. (5%).
5.	The resulting concentration is indeed 5% (0.3 ml 1M solution in 15 ml of FSW (stack solution:   for 50 ml       10.165 gr Mgcl 2·6H2O
6.	Remove the FSW from the tube.
7.	Under a hood Submerge coral sample in Bouin’s fixative (15 parts picric acid : 5 parts formalin: 1 part acetic acid).
8.	 Leave at 4°C 2 hr. at room temperature.
9.	For extended storage, store in 70% sterile ethanol, or leave in PBS for short storage of 2-3 days.
10.	Rinse the samples three times with PBS X3, 10 minutes each.
11.	Keep one intact nubbin as a negative control.
# Decalcification
1.	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.
2.	For scleractinian- decalcification of the skeleton with 1:1 formic acid (50% in DDW) & Sodium citrate 20% (20% in DDW).
3.	Transfer the fixed sample into 50 ml tubes and add the decalcification solution (10 ml in each tube - for samples bigger than 3 cm add 15 ml) for 4-5 hours\overnight.
4.	leave samples in the solution (with cup not fully sealed for gas release) until the skeleton is completely dissolved.
5.	Confirm full decalcification by visual disappearance of the skeleton and preserved tissue structure.
6.	Transfer decalcified tissue into a cassete, mark the sample name on it using a crayon.
7.	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.
8.	Start dehydration immediately or store in 70% methyl alcohol until further processing.
9.	
# Dehydration and embedding
1.	Preheat the incubator and three glass jars filled with paraffin to 58-60 °C for 4 h/overnight to ensure the complete melting of paraffin.
2.	Pass samples through an ethanol series (50% 70%, 90%, 100%). If the tissue is more than 2mm thick extend the last step (100%) to 30min.
3.	Clear the tissue through a series of graded butanol (diluted with ethanol) 50%, 75%, and 100%, 30 min each (the last one can be extended to 1 h).
4.	Remove the butanol and insert the tissue into a glass vial with melted paraffin, incubate 1h in the oven preheated to 58-60 °C
5.	Transfer the tissue into another new glass vial with melted paraffin, incubate overnight
6.	Transfer the tissue into the other glass vial with melted paraffin for 2h.
7.	Take the cassette with the tissue out of the glass vial and use the embedding center to make the paraffin block out of it.
8.	Let the block chill on ice for a few hours and then transfer to 40c overnight.
9.	Before sectioning in microtome, chill the blocks on ice or in ice-cold water.
### Note: All procedures involving hazardous chemicals (e.g., picric acid, formalin) must follow safety protocols and proper waste disposal guidelines.
