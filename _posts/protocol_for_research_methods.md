# **Protocol for fixation, decalcification and embedding of stony corals**    
## This protocol was adjusted and merged from Lisa Skalon’s protocol written on 7.5.2025. and from the methods chapter at Jonathan Levanoni’s paper (2024). 
## **Fixation**  
#### 1.	1.5 ml FSW (0.2 microns filtered seawater) in a 50 ml tube (for small fragments).  
#### 2.	cut and place the sample in the tube.  
#### 3.	Leave the fragments in the tube with the FSW for 10 min before adding 1M mgcl2.  
#### 4.	Add 0.3 ml of 1M mgcl2 to a single tube, and cover the plate with foil for 10 min. (5%?).  
#### 5.	Remove the FSW from the tube.  
#### 6.	Submerge coral sample in Bouin’s fixative (15 parts picric acid : 5 parts formalin : 1 part acetic acid).  
#### 7.	 Leave at 4°C overnight, or 1-2 hr at room temperature.  
#### 8.	Rinse the samples three times with PBS X3, 10 minutes each.  
#### 9.	For extended storage, store in 70% sterile ethanol, or leave in PBS for short storage of 2-3 days.  
#### 10.	Keep one intact nubbin as a negative control.  
## **Decalcification**  
#### 1.	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.  
#### 2.	For scleractinian- decalcification of the skeleton with 1:1 formic acid (50% in DDW) & Sodium citrate 20% (20% in DDW).  
#### 3.	Transfer the fixed sample into 50 ml tubes and add the decalcification solution (10 ml in each tube - for samples bigger than 3 cm add 15 ml) for 4-5 hours\overnight.  
#### 4.	leave samples in the solution until the skeleton is completely dissolved.  
#### 5.	Confirm full decalcification by visual disappearance of the skeleton and preserved tissue structure.  
#### 6.	Rinse thoroughly with running tap water.  
#### 7.	Store in 70% methyl alcohol until further processing.  
#### 8.	Transfer decalcified tissue into a cassete, mark the sample name on it using a crayon. 
#### 9.	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.  
#### 10.	Start the dehydration immediately.  

## **Dehydration and embedding**  
#### 1.	Preheat the incubator and three glass jars filled with paraffin to 58-60 °C for 4 h/overnight to ensure the complete melting of paraffin.  
#### 2.	Pass samples through an ethanol series (70%, 96%, 100%) followed by butanol 15 min each. If the tissue is more than 2mm thick extend the last step (100%) to 30min.  
#### 3.	Clear the tissue through a series of graded butanol (with ethanol) 50%, 75%, 100% and 100%, 30 min each (the last one can be extended to 1 h).  
#### 4.	Remove the butanol and insert the tissue into a glass vial with melted paraffin, incubate 1h in the oven preheated to 58-60 °C.  
#### 5.	Transfer the tissue into another new glass vial with melted paraffin, incubate overnight.  
#### 6.	Transfer the tissue into the other glass vial with melted paraffin for 2h.  
#### 7.	Take the cassette with the tissue out of the glass vial and use the embedding center to make the paraffin block out of it.  
#### 8.	Let the block chill on ice for a few hours and then transfer to 40c overnight.  
#### 9.	Before sectioning in microtome, chill the blocks on ice or in ice-cold water.  

**Note:**  
#### All procedures involving hazardous chemicals (e.g., picric acid, formalin) must follow safety protocols and proper waste disposal guidelines.
