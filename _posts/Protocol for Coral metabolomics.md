# Protocol for Coral Fragments Preparation for LC–MS  
**By Arik Attia — 10.2.2026**

## Overview
This protocol describes the preparation of methanolic extracts from individual coral fragments for **LC–MS analysis** (untargeted metabolomics), including extraction, concentration, reconstitution, clarification, and transfer to LC–MS vials.

---

## Materials and Equipment

### Consumables
1. 50 mL Falcon tubes (one per fragment)  
2. 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf; one per sample + backups)  
3. LC–MS vials with inserts and caps (recommended)  
4. Methanol (LC–MS grade recommended)  

### Equipment
5. Analytical balance (optional, for documentation)  
6. Ultrasonic bath (sonicator)  
7. Evaporator system (rotary evaporator / SpeedVac / nitrogen stream)  
8. Vortex mixer  
9. Centrifuge compatible with 2.0 mL tubes (capable of long spins; temperature control if available)  
10. Pipettes with solvent-resistant tips

## Safety Notes
Methanol is toxic and highly volatile.  
- Work in a certified fume hood  
- Wear gloves and eye protection  
- Dispose of methanol waste as hazardous chemical waste

# Procedure

## 1. Methanolic Extraction (Per Fragment)

1. Place one coral fragment into a labeled **50 mL Falcon tube**.  
2. Add **12 mL methanol**, ensuring complete submersion of the fragment.  
3. Seal the tube tightly.

---

## 2. Sonication

1. Place tubes in an ultrasonic bath **on ice** to maintain low temperature.  
2. Sonicate for **60 minutes**.

---

## 3. Cold Extraction Incubation

1. Transfer tubes to **4°C**.  
2. Incubate for **48 hours** to allow continued metabolite extraction.

---

## 4. Skeleton Removal and Solvent Concentration

1. After 48 hours, remove the coral skeleton from the tube (sterile forceps if needed).  
2. Collect the methanol extract (liquid phase).  
3. Evaporate the solvent **to dryness** using the available evaporator system.  
4. Ensure the extract is fully dry before reconstitution (no residual solvent visible).

---

## 5. Reconstitution

1. Add **2.0 mL methanol** to the dried residue.  
2. Vortex thoroughly until the residue is completely resuspended.

---

## 6. Clarification (Debris Removal)

1. Transfer the reconstituted extract into a labeled **2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube**.  
2. Centrifuge for **30 minutes at 20°C** (or room temperature if temperature control is unavailable).  
3. Carefully collect the **supernatant only**, avoiding disturbance of the pellet.

---

## 7. Transfer to LC–MS Vials

1. Transfer an appropriate volume of clarified supernatant into an **LC–MS vial with insert**.  
2. Cap immediately to minimize evaporation.

---

## Storage Conditions

- **Short-term storage (same/next day):** 4°C  
- **Long-term storage:** −20°C  
- Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles.

---

## Output
Clarified methanolic extract (supernatant) in LC–MS vials, ready for LC–MS injection.
